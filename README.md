# Cybergun

INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS: Download the zip file, go to the folder, click on the file that says "Cybergun", copy the path. You may need to copy the items in the folder to another folder before you can copy the path. Once you do so, open the command prompt and paste the file path.

When you run the program, it will first ask you to enter a command. Type "hack" or "phish", or type "quit" to exit. Typing "help" will just print out the link to this repository.
The program will then ask you a few more questions. When it asks for a password list (it will only do so if you typed "hack" at the beginning), type it out in this format: [itema, itemb, itemc, etc].

Additional notes:

1. If you want to run Cybergun in the command prompt, open it and type "python," then when it opens, type import Cybergun as cg
2. This program can hack accounts on any of the following:
    1. Google
    2. Yahoo
    3. Microsoft
    4. Paypal
    5. Facebook
    6. Twitter
    7. Youtube
    8. Instagram
3. This program is not related to cybergun.com or anything else named Cybergun.
4. You cannot use variables as your password list. It is first come, first served. Copy and paste a list if you want to use it again.
5. The command will sometimes print "Syntax error", meaning you entered the command incorrectly. No further details will be given, as the error recognition code is rather simple. However, you must include the victim's username, the domain (website url), the email address, one action keyword (you can type None if you don't want to use any of the actions), and, if you are using action='loan', type the amount (in US dollars) you want to extract, and then type the username, domain, and email address you want to transfer the money to. You must also provide a password or a password list. Follow these instructions, and you should not get a syntax error message. If you encounter any problems, please state so in the "Issues" section or the "Discussions" section.
6. If you have any other ideas, feel free to tell us.

Happy Cybergunning!
