# Cybergun

INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS: Download the zip file, go to the folder, click on the file that says "Cybergun", copy the path. You may need to copy the items in the folder to another folder before you can copy the path. Once you do so, open the command prompt and paste the file path. You may need to disable your antivirus software to run the program.

When you run the program, it will first ask you to enter a command. Type "hack" or "phish", or type "quit" to exit. Typing "help" will just print out the link to this repository.
The program will then ask you a few more questions. When it asks for a password list (it will only do so if you typed "hack" at the beginning), type it out in this format: [itema, itemb, itemc, etc].

The two keywords in this program are 'loan' and 'pi_theft'. 'Loan' will automatically withdraw a user-defined amount of money from the victim's account, and 'pi_theft' will find and print out the victim's information. If you don't want to use either of these and just want the password, type 'None'.

Additional notes:

1. This program can hack accounts on any of the following:
    1. Google
    2. Yahoo
    3. Microsoft
    4. Paypal
    5. Facebook
    6. Twitter
    7. Youtube
    8. Instagram
2. This program is not related to cybergun.com or anything else named Cybergun.
3. Do not use quote marks when typing in your answers to the prompts. (Only exception is inside your password lists, when you type out the strings you want the program to use).
4. You cannot use variables as your password list. It is first come, first served. Copy and paste a list if you want to use it again.
5. The command will sometimes print "Syntax error", meaning you entered the command incorrectly. No further details will be given, as the error recognition code is rather simple. However, you must include the victim's username, the domain (website url), the email address, one action keyword (you can type None if you don't want to use any of the actions), and, if you are using 'loan', type the amount (in US dollars) you want to extract, and then type the email address you want to transfer the money to. You must also provide a password list. Follow these instructions, and you should not get a syntax error message. If you encounter any problems, please state so in the "Issues" section or the "Discussions" section.
6. If you have any ideas, feel free to tell us.

Happy Cybergunning!
